                <p class="trivial-description">During the Development Internship with Trivial I learned to collaborate as part of a professional development team. This was my first experience working in a remote role. I contributed to a JavaScript action library to integrate automations into the codebase. I became acclimated into the Agile environment and Pull Request creation.</p>
